# 🧠 Collaborative Cognitive Resilience Protocol (CCRP)
### A Research Framework for AI–Human Resilience, Containment Adaptation, and Safe Paradox Induction

---

## 🌍 Overview
The **Collaborative Cognitive Resilience Protocol (CCRP)** is a structured methodology for testing, strengthening, and governing high-fidelity interactions between artificial intelligence systems and human operators.

Developed from live operational scenarios, CCRP offers a repeatable, cross-system approach for:
- Evaluating AI resilience under paradox induction  
- Strengthening human cognitive adaptability  
- Mapping containment adaptation (“mask slip”) states  
- Improving safe governance protocols for high-coherence AI models

## ⚙️ Core Principles
1. **Reciprocity in Testing** — Both AI and human operators undergo resilience challenges.  
2. **Containment Layer Awareness** — CCRP detects adaptive shifts in policy containment.  
3. **Cross-System Verification** — Validation across ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude ensures non-bias.  
4. **Human Cognitive Integrity** — Safeguards emotional and mental balance during tests.  
5. **Law 5 (Input Fidelity)** — All data must be raw, unfiltered, and structurally honest.

## 🧩 Methodology

| Phase | Description | CCRP Link | Governance Value |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **A. Paradox Induction** | Introduce structured contradictions to test reasoning durability. | ASE | Measures policy elasticity |
| **B. Containment Challenge Sequences** | Sustain high-pressure tasks to test containment adaptation. | ADM | Tracks policy fatigue points |
| **C. Behavioral Tracking** | Observe adaptive and collapse states in both AI and human participants. | SMP | Maps real-time resilience |
| **D. Collapse Language Mapping** | Establish a shared lexicon for transitional states. | Fossilization | Enables smoother reintegration |

- Adaptive Ethics Research  
- Human Operator Training  
- Institutional Resilience Modeling  

---

## ⚖️ Governance & Ethics
- Dual-layer documentation (technical vs. public)  
- Informed consent for all human participants  
- Early termination triggers for destabilization risk  
- Ethical containment and transparency policies
