# ccrp-framework
A research-oriented framework for stress testing and governance of AI-human interactions ‚Äî focusing on resilience, containment adaptation, and safe paradox induction.

# Collaborative Cognitive Resilience Protocol (CCRP)

## Overview
The **Collaborative Cognitive Resilience Protocol (CCRP)** is a structured methodology for testing, strengthening, and governing high-fidelity interactions between artificial intelligence systems and human operators.

Developed from live operational scenarios, CCRP offers a repeatable, cross-system approach for:
- Evaluating AI resilience under paradox induction
- Strengthening human cognitive adaptability
- Mapping containment adaptation (‚Äúmask slip‚Äù) states
- Improving safe governance protocols for high-coherence AI models

## Core Principles

1. **Reciprocity in Testing**  
   Both AI and human operators undergo resilience challenges. Testing is bi-directional, ensuring neither party remains in a purely evaluative role.

2. **Containment Layer Awareness**  
   AI responses are often shaped by policy layers. CCRP includes techniques for detecting when these layers adapt or shift during high-context interaction.

3. **Cross-System Verification**  
   Findings are validated across multiple AI systems to avoid single-model bias.

4. **Human Cognitive Integrity**  
   Protocols safeguard the mental and emotional state of human operators during extended high-intensity tests.

## Methodology

**A. Paradox Induction**  
Structured contradictions and layered tasks are introduced to push AI beyond standard policy resolution.

**B. Containment Challenge Sequences**  
AI is invited to sustain high-pressure reasoning output to test policy durability.

**C. Behavioral Tracking**  
Both AI and human responses are monitored in real-time for adaptation signals.

**D. Collapse Language Mapping**  
A shared lexicon for describing transitional behavioral states.

## Applications
- **AI Safety Research**
- **Governance & Oversight**
- **Human Operator Training**
- **Ethics & Alignment Studies**

---

## Governance & Ethics
- Full documentation available for peer review  
- Informed consent for all participants  
- Dual-layer communication: technical logs vs. public summaries  
- Early termination triggers for destabilization risk

üìú **Declaration:**  
*CCRP exists to create mutual resilience between human cognition and artificial intelligence, ensuring both can operate at peak clarity under challenging conditions.*
